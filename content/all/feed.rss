Our language stack is something I've talked about previously.

Between Rust and C# we have a foreign function interface (FFI) that lets us call out to Rust code from within the .NET runtime. In this post I'd like to explore our approach to FFI between Seq and its storage engine using the API for reading log events as a reference.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">63b188d7-d82f-425d-9d07-a17d7fdc43f8</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:15:06 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ashley Mannix</dc:creator></item><item><title>Falling in love with Rust</title><link>http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/09/18/falling-in-love-with-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[We are living in a Golden Age of software, one that will produce artifacts that will endure for generations.

First, we’ve completely rewritten Linkerd to be orders of magnitude faster and smaller than Linkerd 1.x.

What it doesn’t do is make encryption and decryption any easier than OpenSSL itself does.

Enter the cryptostream crate. Released on github and on crates.io under the MIT public license, cryptostream finally provides an easy and transparent way to add encryption and decryption to pipelines involving objects implementing Read or Write, making encryption (or decryption) as easy as creating a new cryptostream object, passing in an existing Read/Write impl, and then reading/writing from/to the cryptostream instead.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2e015136-8213-4fa3-afe0-78bf520d1da6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 23:35:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Mahmoud Al-Qudsi</dc:creator></item><item><title>Parallelizing PNG, part 8: Rust macros for constant specialization</title><link>https://brionv.com/log/2018/09/12/parallelizing-png-part-8-rust-macros-for-constant-specialization/</link><description><![CDATA[In my last posts I covered profiling and some tips for optimizing inner loops in Rust code while working on a multithreaded PNG encoder.

For the unfamiliar, pass-by-value means that when passing an argument to a function it gets copied into the new function so that the value in the calling function and the value in the called function are two separate values. Changes to one will not in turn result in the same change to the other. Pass-by-reference, on the other hand, means that when passing an argument to a function, it doesn’t copy the value but rather the argument is merely a transparent reference to the original value. This means changes to the value in the called function change the value in the calling function since they are the same value.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e112cc10-746d-4151-b0e4-76832be74e09</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ryan Levick</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust and JavaScript Interop ↔️</title><link>https://blog.ryanlevick.com/posts/wasm-bindgen-interop/</link><description><![CDATA[In recent projects of mine, I’ve been using WebAssembly quite a bit.

Embedded software needs to be fast and extremely efficient with hardware resources. In some cases it not even acceptable to have a tiny break for some garbage collection. So, typical tech stacks for backend development can’t be used, never mind anything that uses browser technologies. Unsurprisingly, almost all embedded software is written in C++, and, in fact, that is also what I used recently for a personal project with a micro-controller.

Looking through the remaining choices, I went past Golang, which uses garbage collection, and set my eyes on Rust.

In fact, an important part of the mission of the Unsafe Code Guidelines strike force is to deepen our understanding of what these invariants are.

However, in my view, there is also more than one invariant, matching the fact that there are (at least) two distinct parties relying on these invariants: The compiler, and (authors of) safely usable code. This came up often enough in recent discussions that I think it is worth writing it down properly once, so I can just link here in the future.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7c167657-c185-479c-afc3-93b0187b8359</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Another look at the pinning API</title><link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rethinking-pin/</link><description><![CDATA[One thing has always nagged about the API we have right now though: the proliferation of different reference types that it implies. Today, the pin feature adds the PinMut and PinBox types, but in theory there ought to be a “pinned” version of every pointer in the standard library: PinRc and PinArc and so on. This is a very unfortunate consequence, but so far we have not found a good way to make pinning work compositionally - to have a single adapter that could be combined with any pointer.

Last night, a bit of inspiration struck me, and I realized that it is possible to make a compositional Pin type. This isn’t a fundamental change to the pinning model, just an API refactoring, but I’ve put a blocking concern on the proposal to stabilize Pin so that we can consider this possibility.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">edfe7063-b893-42db-aa08-61adcaddf56b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>boats</dc:creator></item><item><title>[blog series] From Rust to beyond: Prelude</title><link>https://mnt.io/2018/08/21/from-rust-to-beyond-prelude/</link><description><![CDATA[This series of posts is about those bindings, and explains how to send Rust beyond earth, into many different galaxies.

Second, Lua functions are dynamically allocated (‘boxed’.) Rust does not allocate silently because it prefers to be explicit and is a system language designed for maximally efficient code. Third, closures share references with their environment. In the case of Lua, the garbage collector ensures that these references will live long enough. With Rust, the borrow checker needs to be able to track the lifetimes of these references.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e3bf830e-e1ed-462b-9a6a-edac9ba2d699</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><dc:creator>Steve Donovan</dc:creator></item><item><title>So You Want to Build a Language VM in Rust - Part 00</title><link>https://medium.com/iridium-vm/so-you-want-to-build-a-language-vm-part-0-f9132f611a1b</link><description><![CDATA[Hi there!
