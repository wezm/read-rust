Thruster is a middleware based web server written in Rust (get it, th-rust-er? I’m working on my tight 5 for amateur night at The Apollo,) and as such, I needed a way to load HTML templates and insert variables into them in a performant way. Rather than poking around the numerous existing libraries and choosing one made by someone I don’t know — stranger danger! — I decided to make it myself. This article is about that journey, the unbelievably thrilling adventures of writing my first proc_macro_derive in Rust.",

Even a 1% improvement in compression efficiency can make a huge difference. That’s why we conduct research into lossless compression algorithms that are highly tuned for certain classes of files and storage, like Lepton for jpeg images, and Pied-Piper-esque lossless video encoding. For other file types, Dropbox currently uses the zlib compression format, which saves almost 8% of disk storage.\n\nWe introduce DivANS, our latest open-source contribution to compression, in this blog post.",

Once this happens, I don’t plan to release any further breaking changes to the failure crate (though maybe someday in the distant future).\nBreaking changes in 1.0 failure is in a somewhat unique position as being a significant part of the public API of other libraries that depend on it. Whether they use the Error struct or derive Fail for a custom error type, this becomes a part of the API they expose to other users.",

The support for SQLite is almost as complete as the one for PostgreSQL: the only missing function is not implemented because the backend (SQLite) does not support it.",

There’ll be some more changes, though, at least because Tokio just released a new version (and Futures plan to do so soon), so Corona will have to adapt.",

However other projects (cough gluon cough) got in the way and Combine fell to the wayside. It didn’t help that I didn’t have a killer feature for 3.0 either, user-defined error types make it possible to define parsers usable in #[no_std] crates which is great when you need it but it is still a fairly niche use-case.",
