      "content_text": "So because it seemed like a good idea at the time, I decided to port the minimp3 library from C to Rust. I want a pure Rust MP3 decoder crate to exist under a permissive license, I wanted to learn a few things about the MP3 file format, and it seemed small enough to do in a single weekend. (In reality it was largely done in about a week.) I’m quite good at Rust, and I’m okay at C (but rusty; hah!), and I know nothing at all about MP3 decoding. So, it was a fun learning experience. It was very interesting seeing how C and Rust’s different feature set changed how the programs were written. minimp3 turned out to be a good choice for this, since it is standalone, pretty well-written C as far as I can tell, does nothing that needs to be unsafe, and small but not trivial. This article is an attempt to organize my thoughts, notes and observations as I went about the project, in the hopes that it will be useful or at least interesting to someone else.",

While I don’t completely disagree with this sentiment, it’s also never quite sat right with me. Yes, Rust is a bit harder at the start, but once you get over a hump, I don’t generally find writing Rust to be significantly harder than using a GC’d language.

Second, Lua functions are dynamically allocated (‘boxed’.) Rust does not allocate silently because it prefers to be explicit and is a system language designed for maximally efficient code. Third, closures share references with their environment. In the case of Lua, the garbage collector ensures that these references will live long enough. With Rust, the borrow checker needs to be able to track the lifetimes of these references.",

The points demonstrate real difficulties with attempting to use a general framework for these problems and to me serves perfectly as a “the ball’s in your court now” to anyone claiming Rust is ignoring theory and coming up with unnecessary solutions to solved problems: if you think Rust could use monadic abstractions, you have to be able to address these counterarguments.",

In fact, an important part of the mission of the Unsafe Code Guidelines strike force is to deepen our understanding of what these invariants are.\n\nHowever, in my view, there is also more than one invariant, matching the fact that there are (at least) two distinct parties relying on these invariants: The compiler, and (authors of) safely usable code. This came up often enough in recent discussions that I think it is worth writing it down properly once, so I can just link here in the future.",

Today, the pin feature adds the PinMut and PinBox types, but in theory there ought to be a “pinned” version of every pointer in the standard library: PinRc and PinArc and so on. This is a very unfortunate consequence, but so far we have not found a good way to make pinning work compositionally - to have a single adapter that could be combined with any pointer.\n\nLast night, a bit of inspiration struck me, and I realized that it is possible to make a compositional Pin type. This isn’t a fundamental change to the pinning model, just an API refactoring, but I’ve put a blocking concern on the proposal to stabilize Pin so that we can consider this possibility.",

However, the log create is just a facade, and by default the messages do not get emitted anywhere. The calling code has to set up a logger. Crates like env_logger let one set up a logger, during program initialization, that gets configured through an environment variable. This is a problem for librsvg: we are not the program's initialization! Librsvg is a library; it doesn't have a main() function. And since most of the calling code is not Rust, we can't assume that they can call code that can initialize the logging framework.",

As I see it, there is no truer answer. The type system can be a seductive beast, often promising correctness and performance at the low-low, one-time cost of your soul.

As such, many of the edge cases are likely to fall away as we develop after stabilization and come up with standard methods to work with the new feature.\n\nThe primary work to migrate is essentially just deleting ~all lifetime headers (<'a, 'b, 'c>) across impls and functions. More intensive migration would involve replacing untied/single-use lifetimes with '_ in all cases. This is quite hard to do from a person perspective (though compiler can likely do so fairly easily).",

      "content_text": "This summer, I am again working on Rust full-time, and again I will work (amongst other things) on a “memory model” for Rust/MIR. However, before I can talk about the ideas I have for this year, I have to finally take the time and dispel the myth that “pointers are simple: they are just integers”. Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.\n\nI also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what is the data that is stored in memory? It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte? Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.\n\nI hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)",

      "content_text": "For some time now (since the 1.26 release, to be precise), Rust has a very powerful machinery for CTFE, or compile-time function evaluation. Since then, there have been various discussions about which operations should be allowed during CTFE, which checks the compiler should do, how this all relates to promotion and which kinds of guarantees we should be able to expect around CTFE. This post is my take on those topics, and it should not be surprising that I am going to take a very type-system centric view. Expect something like a structured brain dump, so there are some unanswered questions towards the end as well.",

I think people tend to bundle the two languages together because they were released at about the same time and the release of Rust felt like a response to the release of Go. Moreover, both languages are supposed to focus on systems software. But they are vastly different, and even as they both target systems software, they target different kinds of such software.",

We chose Rust not because it is popular, but because we believe it is the best tool for the job we have to do, and I hope to explain that reasoning now.",

Unfortunately, today’s nightly doesn’t work due to infrastructure issues, so you’ll need to run rustup install nightly-2018-06-20 in order to get a nightly that’ll work.

If you’ve not done so already, I strongly recommend reading aturon’s excellent blog posts on this topic.\n\nThe RFC process has also evolved somewhat organically over time. What began as “just open a pull request on GitHub” has moved into a process with a number of formal and informal stages (described below).

For that reason, you see a great deal of encouragement nowadays to move to newer languages - they're designed with contemporary platforms in mind, rather than working within the limitations of platforms like the PDP-11. Among said \"new languages\" are Zig, Myrddin, Go, Nim, D, Rust.. even languages like Java and Elixir that run on a virtual machine are occasionally suggested as alternatives to the AOT-compiled C and C++.\n\nI have plans to look into the characteristics that distinguish each and every one of these new programming languages, learning them and documenting my first impressions in the form of blog posts.

Only 20% is the actual instrumentation of application code.\n\nSo, starting with Python, our goal became \"how do we prevent more duplication\". In order to do that, we decided to split the agent into two components. A language agent and a core agent. The language agent is the Python component, and the core agent is a standalone executable that contains most of the shared logic.",

      "content_text": "Rust doesn’t allow you to move out of a value which type implements Drop, and this is quite logical. When Foo::take returns, because of self going out of scope, it must call its Drop::drop implementation. If you have moved out of it – both a: A and b: B fields, the Drop::drop implementation is now a complete UB. So Rust is right here and doesn’t allow you to do this.\n\nBut imagine that we have to do this. For insance, we need to hand over both the scarce resources a and b to another struct (in our case, a (A, B), but you could easily imagine a better type for this).\n\nThere’s a way to, still, implement Foo::take with Foo implementing Drop. Here’s how:",

It passes the full NLL test suite and also handles a few cases – such as #47680 – that the current NLL analysis cannot handle. However, the performance has a long way to go (it is currently slower than existing analysis). That said, I haven’t even begun to optimize yet, and I know I am doing some naive and inefficient things that can definitely be done better; so I am still optimistic we’ll be able to make big strides there.",

Embedded standards are very opinionated about software practices—like using floating point values as loop counters or the number of possible exit points of a function—and Rust’s defaults don’t prevent every runtime panic (for example, recursion that goes too deep and overflows the stack).\n\nFor PolySync, a runtime panic means the potential for an unsafe situation on the road, and with that in mind, we’ve explored ways to restrict that potential. Of course, we aren’t the only ones thinking about ways to improve the quality of code at compile time by enforcing the right rules for the job. Active projects like rust-clippy are working to do that too by providing lints to supplement the rustc defaults.\n\nIn this post we’ll explore how to enforce a rule by prohibiting a practice we’ve formed an opinion about, the indexing of a vector or an array.",

One such language is C. Language standards that define allowable subsets (e.g. MISRA) and static analysis tools are often used in an attempt to ameliorate these failures by detecting them in the program code before they result in a critical issue at runtime. These traditional methods are ultimately insufficient when it comes to providing ahead-of-time assurances about safe runtime behavior for safety-critical applications.

On the other hand, once it compiles, many classes of errors will already have been taken care of, so your code will usually work as expected (or if you’re new to Rust, unexpectedly well).",

That very same principle, event-driven I/O, is the same reason I chose Node.js for most of the APIs I’ve developed since 2011. Even if practices change, we retain successful engineering models.\n\nBeginning late last year, as I sketched our founding mission and initial product offerings, I also decided to select a new primary language that could handle most of our primary development tasks. After writing mostly JavaScript and compile-to-JS languages for half a decade, I longed for something more.",

Knowing that certain things just cannot be done helps putting your mind back back on the right track.\n\nSo here are things not to do in Rust and what to do instead which I think should be better known.",

One is to restrict the programming language and disallow pointers. But, this forces most programs to make unnecessary copies of data. Another strategy, called garbage collection, embeds a garbage collector with every program. The garbage collector periodically looks for objects in memory that cannot be accessed from the program and reclaims this memory. The drawbacks of this are the overhead of garbage collection and that deallocation of memory is no longer under the control of the programmer.",

As I said back then: I held myself to the same constraints as the original contest; no external packages is a bit painful in Rust, but it’s not too bad. Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages?

      "content_text": "Lifetimes are a interesting subject: a lot of people seem to gain a day-to-day familiarity with them, without fully understanding what they are. Maybe, they are truly Rust's Monads. Let's talk about what they are, where you encounter them and then how to get competent with them.",

      "content_text": "As a newcomer to Rust, I heard the phrase “procedural macro” thrown around a lot without really understanding what it meant. I figured that I would learn about them if I ever needed them. Well, I’m working on the guts of relm, and a large chunk of it is procedural macros. I’ve learned enough about procedural macros to be dangerous, so I thought I would pass on some knowledge.",

      "content_text": "In the first post, we looked at the relationship between generators and a more general notion of self-references. In the second post, we narrowed down exactly what problem we need to solve to make generators work, and talked about some solutions that we’ve considered but don’t feel like we could ship in the near future.\nIn the original post, I promised that I would have a near term solution by the end of this series.",
