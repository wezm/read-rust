Like codemod, it is a tool to assist you with large-scale codebase refactors, and it supports most of codemod's options. fastmod's major philosophical difference from codemod is that it is focused on improving the use case \"I want to use interactive mode to make sure my regex is correct, and then I want to apply the regex everywhere\". For this use case, it offers much better performance than codemod",

      "content_text": "I had an itch: I was pretty-printing the BERT-encoded terms that we use in a production system at work and it was very slow. The Erlang shell took more than two minutes to dump the largest file. (It took about 0.1 second to read and parse the file; the rest was spent in io:format.) I decided to scratch that itch: I wrote ppbert, a command-line utility that reads BERT-encoded values and pretty-prints them. I’ve worked sporadically on ppbert for almost a year now, I use it daily at work, I’m happy with it, and I want to write about some of the things I learned during that journey.",

Namely, the combination of workspaces, aliases and ability to define binaries seems to do the trick.",
