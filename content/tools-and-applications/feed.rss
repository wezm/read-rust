I discovered it in 2008 (probably on YouTube), downloaded the best copy I could find, and filed it away in the TODO list. Recent advances in international parcel forwarding technology let me buy a used copy last year, but when it arrived none of my CD drives could read track #3. This sort of thing is common when buying used CDs, especially if they need to transit a USPS international shipping center. I shelved it and kept on the lookout for another copy, which I located last month. It arrived on Friday, I immediately tried to rip it, and hit the exact same error. This didn’t seem to be an issue of wear or damage…]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">bf6d4501-afb3-40dc-aa8a-bef247e2e77b</guid><pubDate>Thu,  2 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>John Millikin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Sequoia, a new OpenPGP implementation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/93mng5/ann_sequoia_a_new_openpgp_implementation/</link><description><![CDATA[This past fall, three former GnuPG developers began working on a new OpenPGP implementation in Rust called Sequoia.

If you have server with >100 virtual machines, and each virtual machines have one or more additional disk and a few network interfaces, it’s hard to find which VM cause stress on the server. Normal atop simply couldn’t cope with hundreds of tap/tun interfaces, multitude of block devices, etc. When I found that I have no proper tooling (as an operator) I wrote a shabby tools to do my job: they are calling blktop and ifstop. Both were written dirty and fast, and they does not follow the usual Python conventions (but they work as standalone binaries). They do their job, and normally I would say that’s enough. But those utilities are simple and have no big complications under the hood, so they are perfect candidates for rewriting in Rust for the sake of writing in Rust (I’m learning it!). I decide to combine them into a single utility: devtop, which I want to develop properly, according to Rust conventions, and through all aspects of packaging.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f6f626f4-47ff-427c-8d44-b63c457bed46</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 14:21:28 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>George Shuklin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Oxy - A Security Focused Remote Access Tool</title><link>https://oxy-secure.app/</link><description><![CDATA[It's like SSH, but more secure, and with cool modern features.

Angle grinder can process about a million rows per second, so it's usable for fairly meaty aggregation. The results will live update in your terminal as data is processed.
