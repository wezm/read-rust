AV1 is an open and royalty-free video coding format, concurrent with HEVC (H.265). Rav1e is an encoder written in Rust, developped by Mozilla/Xiph. As such, it takes an input video and encodes it to produce a valid AV1 bitstream. Tile encoding consists in splitting video frames into tiles that can be encoded and decoded independently in parallel (to use several CPUs), at the cost of a small loss in compression efficiency. This speeds up encoding and increases decoding frame rate.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">47f0e720-8b24-41d0-8f3a-97683b5f03b3</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Romain Vimont</dc:creator></item><item><title>The XV Hex Viewer</title><link>https://chrisvest.github.io/xv/</link><description><![CDATA[XV is a terminal hex viewer with a text user interface, written in 100% safe Rust.

In the second part of that post I described the problems the tool runs into when dealing with indirect function calls (both function pointer calls and dynamic dispatch) and proposed improving the output of the tool by having rustc inject type information in the LLVM IR it produces.

While discussing that idea with rustc developers they noted that the compiler could emit information that’s more relevant to call graph analysis than just the signatures of functions and trait methods. In this post I’ll describe the call graph metadata I’m currently implementing in rustc and how it will help tools like cargo-call-stack. By the way, I have a feature branch of cargo-call-stack that uses this upcoming rustc feature if you want to try it out but you’ll need to build a custom rustc.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e57004c9-8a39-47af-bd60-b97fbcd07e7a</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Terminal Redox: Some Developer Tools Written in Rust</title><link>https://sts10.github.io//2019/04/08/terminal-redox-alacritty.html</link><description><![CDATA[In my very slow and not very steady quest to learn the Rust programming language, I’ve come across a few projects written in the language that I use everyday. I thought I’d write a quick post about them, with some configuration tricks that I’ve made to make them suit my needs.

Why prefer tools built with Rust? Rust is a very fast language that also works to ensure safety from a group of bugs and pitfalls. It’s also the four-time-running most loved programming language, according to a yearly Stack Overflow survey. Also, since Rust is only a few years old, any program written in Rust is by definition new. Of course newer doesn’t always mean better, but as a non-professional developer I can afford to be on the edge a bit.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2d3bd098-bf1d-451b-bef0-b2e84678b4e3</guid><pubDate>Mon,  8 Apr 2019 22:11:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sam Schlinkert</dc:creator></item><item><title>Alacritty Version 0.3.0</title><link>https://blog.christianduerr.com/alacritty_030_announcement</link><description><![CDATA[ Alacritty is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance.

The first two (here and here) introduced a new (at the time) framework for version control. The third post, which I never finished, was going to talk about the datastructures and algorithms used in pijul, a version control system built around that new framework. The problem is that pijul is a complex piece of software, and so I had lots of trouble wrapping my head around it.

Two years later, I’m finally ready to continue with this series of posts (but having learned from my earlier mistakes, I’m not going to predict the total number of posts ahead of time). In the meantime, I’ve written my own toy version control system (VCS) to help me understand what’s going on. It’s called ojo, and it’s extremely primitive: to start with, it can only track a single file. However, it is (just barely) sophisticated enough to demonstrate the important ideas.

I use a password manager called KeePassXC, so all of my passwords are stored in an encrypted file – a KeePass database – and I use a program called KeePassXC, a free and open-source password manager, to manage them (I wrote a beginner’s user guide to KeePassXC a while back if you’re interested!). So ideally, to check my passwords against the big list, I’d have a tool that checks all the passwords in a given KeePass database against the entire HaveIBeenPwned list of passwords, preferably against the downloaded file (i.e. “offline”), rather than the API. In other words something similar to 1Password’s Watchtower feature, but preferably offline.

After poking around a bit I decided to write it myself in Rust, with this script and this crate as useful references. Medic is a Rust CLI that can perform a variety of “health” checks on a KeePass database.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ba72d3fb-8f1e-4802-a55b-15dd8584046f</guid><pubDate>Fri,  1 Feb 2019 01:15:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sam Schlinkert</dc:creator></item><item><title>Mod player in Rust - part 2</title><link>https://www.codeslow.com/2019/01/mod-player-in-rust-part-2.html</link><description><![CDATA[My last article finished with reading the pattern tables from the mode files.

Since I’m not in school for a month, I usually take the time to do some self-study on a topic I find interesting. This past month, it was building a database. Unfortunately, I had only a casual understanding of how a database actually works under the hood, and no idea how to get started. Additionally, I decided to write the database in Rust, since I knew there would be complicated management of data, and I wanted to avoid headaches involving invalid data. Finally, rust’s static garbage collector meant I wouldn’t have to rely on a runtime to guarantee this.

That was a month ago. While I’m not too far along (mostly due to being busier than expected during the break), I still have things I think are worth sharing.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a4e3cb9f-0d9d-4a47-98cd-2b51d39b7eb6</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nate Lincoln</dc:creator></item><item><title>sharkdp/hexyl: A command-line hex viewer</title><link>https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl</link><description><![CDATA[hexyl is a simple hex viewer for the terminal.

To make my life easier, I wanted to leverage Linux’s FUSE interface to expose the audio on SoundCloud as a bunch of files in a folder which MPD could then index and play from. I could have taken a couple of other approaches such as swapping MPD with Mopidy, an MPD-compatible music player with SoundCloud support, or a scraper that periodically downloads the latest audio from my feed. And while these alternatives were probably easier to implement, I went for the FUSE driver because I thought it was cool.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4a2d72d8-3aa4-4c82-a95f-847f3e0c650d</guid><pubDate>Wed,  2 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>polyfloyd</dc:creator></item><item><title>Debugging Rust with VSCode on FreeBSD</title><link>https://venshare.com/debugging-rust-with-vscode-on-freebsd/</link><description><![CDATA[The following is a set of notes for installing VSCode on FreeBSD and getting a debugger up and running in a step by step guide.

I discovered it in 2008 (probably on YouTube), downloaded the best copy I could find, and filed it away in the TODO list. Recent advances in international parcel forwarding technology let me buy a used copy last year, but when it arrived none of my CD drives could read track #3. This sort of thing is common when buying used CDs, especially if they need to transit a USPS international shipping center. I shelved it and kept on the lookout for another copy, which I located last month. It arrived on Friday, I immediately tried to rip it, and hit the exact same error. This didn’t seem to be an issue of wear or damage…]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">bf6d4501-afb3-40dc-aa8a-bef247e2e77b</guid><pubDate>Thu,  2 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>John Millikin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Sequoia, a new OpenPGP implementation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/93mng5/ann_sequoia_a_new_openpgp_implementation/</link><description><![CDATA[This past fall, three former GnuPG developers began working on a new OpenPGP implementation in Rust called Sequoia.

If you have server with >100 virtual machines, and each virtual machines have one or more additional disk and a few network interfaces, it’s hard to find which VM cause stress on the server. Normal atop simply couldn’t cope with hundreds of tap/tun interfaces, multitude of block devices, etc. When I found that I have no proper tooling (as an operator) I wrote a shabby tools to do my job: they are calling blktop and ifstop. Both were written dirty and fast, and they does not follow the usual Python conventions (but they work as standalone binaries). They do their job, and normally I would say that’s enough. But those utilities are simple and have no big complications under the hood, so they are perfect candidates for rewriting in Rust for the sake of writing in Rust (I’m learning it!).
